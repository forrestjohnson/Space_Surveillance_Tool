# Introduction
This document is intended to lay out the requirements of the Space Surveillance Tool as decided by the developer (Forrest Johnson) and stakeholder (James Johnson).

## 1.1 Product Scope
The Space Surveillance Tool (SST) will adapt the functionality of the Space Surveillance Analysis Tool excel file to a webpage-based interface.  

## 1.2 Product Value
Stakeholder will have access to the tool in a more usable form than an excel file.  Developer will gain experience and a project for their portfolio.

## 1.3 Intended Audience
The primary audience is the Stakeholder who will use the tool.  Secondary audiences include the developer and individuals reviewing the developer's portfolio.

## 1.4 Intended Use
The intended audience will use this tool to model satellite orbits around the Earth and track the access of specified ground sites to the orbitting satellites over time.

## 1.5 General Description
Users of the tool should be able to adjust the view of the earth model along altitude, longitude, and azimuth.
Users should be able to set the following satellite characteristics:
* Number of Orbit Planes
* Number of Satellites per Plane
* Orbit Altitude (km)
* Orbit Incliination (deg)
* Phasing Parameter
Users should be able to set the following satellite sensor characteristics:
* Minimum LOS Horizon Angle (deg)
* Maximum Sensor Range (km)
* Nadir Pointing Sensor FOV (deg)
Users should be able to set the following observed ground site characteristics:
* Observed Site Latitude (deg)
* Observed Site Longitude (deg)
Users should be able to set the point in time of the 24 hour period to model, and a graph will show the number of accessible satellites over the 24 hour period.
